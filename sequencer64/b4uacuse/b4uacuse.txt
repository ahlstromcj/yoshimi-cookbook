2012-01-20 to 2016-04-03

This file describes the importing of one of my old Cakewalk transcriptions, a
rendering of Eric Clapton and Robert Cray from a transcription that someone
gave to me to try out.


Yoshimi parts from the gm-basic bank:

   1. Ch 10.  0129-Drum Kit.xiz
   2. Ch  6.  0011-Music Box.xiz
   3. Ch  7.  0049-String Ensemble 1.xiz
   4. Ch  9.  0034-Electric Bass finger.xiz
   5. Ch  8.  0007-Harpsichord.xiz
   6. Ch  3.  0093-Pad 5 bowed.xiz
   7. Ch  2.  0094-Pad 6 metallic.xiz
   8. Ch  5.  0063-Brass Section.xiz
   9. Ch  4.  0115-Steel Drums.xiz (muted)

The bank must be installed in ~/.config/yoshimi-cookbook/banks.

Sequencer64 settings:

   [1] seq24 1 Channel 10

To set up and play the tune (using ALSA):

   1. Make sure that the seq24 or sequencer64 config ("rc") files
      specify 0 for manual-alsa-ports, and do not set up any MIDI clocks.

   2. yoshimi -a -A -l wpb_yoshimi_params.xmz

   3. sequencer64 wpb_yoshimi.midi &

   4. File / Options / MIDI Clock:  Verify which MIDI buss Yoshimi is
      on.  In our case, it is on buss 5 (buss 0 is Midi Through, and 1
      through 4 are ports created by TiMidity).  There are probably better
      ways to do this, but right click on each pattern to select buss 5 and
      the channel shown after the dash in the lower left corner of each
      pattern.  Probably best to save this to a new file, just in case.

   5. Open the Song Editor of sequencer64.  Click the red play arrow.
