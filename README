Yoshimi Document

This project provides two things:

   1. A cookbook, still in progress, to cover doing things with Yoshimi
      that might not be so obvious, even after reading the user's manual.

   2. Sample banks, presets, and instruments to accompany the cookbook.

To recreate the PDF file (the latest version is stored in the "pdf"
directory), you will need to install GNU make, latexmk, tex-live, pdf2latex,
and other resources related to LaTeX and PDF support.  If everything is
in place, then change to the "tex" directory, and a simple "make" command
will create the document.

"make clean" in the "tex" directory will remove all of the generated
products.

Actually, both "make" and "make clean" are supported from the top-level
of the project, for convenience, and "make" archives the PDF file if the
build succeeds.

Lastly, although this cookbook is well underway, it needs a lot of work and
a lot of help!
