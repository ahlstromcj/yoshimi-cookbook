\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

   This document is a follow-on to the author's
   "A Yoshimi User Manual" \cite{yoshimidoc}.
   The user manual attempts complete coverage of the user-interface and
   concepts behind \textsl{Yoshimi}.
   This cookbook attempts to provide recipes to solve some common problems
   in getting \textsl{Yoshimi} to perform at its best for the user.

\subsection{Project Structure}
\label{subsec:introduction_project_structure}

   The "Yoshimi Cookbook" project consists of two parts:

   \begin{itemize}
      \item The source material for this document.
      \item A self contained "yoshimi" configuration and data
            section to support the examples in this cookbook.
   \end{itemize}

   The documentation source-files are provided in the \texttt{tex}
   directory.  They are use to create the cookbook via Makefiles and
   the external "latexmk" project.  The result of a "make" is a new
   PDF of the cookbook in the \texttt{pdf} directory.  The latest
   PDF is always provided there so that one does not have to install the
   external projects needed to create it.

   The configuration, banks, presets, and instrument files can be used
   to supplement or replaces the user's own configuration and data files.

\subsection{What Game Shall We Play Today?}
\label{subsec:introduction_what_game}

   There are a number of recipes that are hinted at in the user manual, but
   that solve problems that the author has encountered while using
   \textsl{Yoshimi}.

   \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Banks and MIDI}.
         \textsl{Yoshimi} has had recent modifications to support
         bank-switching and using program-change messages to make
         \textsl{Yoshimi} a more flexible MIDI playback tool.
      \item \textbf{General MIDI}.
         It should be possible to set up one or more banks that
         are General MIDI compliant.
      \item \textbf{Usage of Modulators}.
         \textsl{Yoshimi} provides a number of modulation setups,
         but it isn't clear how to use them, especially the ring modulator.
      \item \textbf{More! ...}
   \end{itemize}
