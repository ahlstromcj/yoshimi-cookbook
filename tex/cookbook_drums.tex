\section{Drums}
\label{sec:drums}

   This section contains some drums hints.  More to come.

\subsection{Drums / New}
\label{subsec:drums_new}

   From Will Godfrey:

   There will be two new entries in the drums bank with this release, Ride
   Crash and Soft Shaker. With these along with some of the other individual
   drum instruments the comments include the behaviour over the note range.

   It may seem wasteful to not put these in a kit, but my idea is to have as
   many of the individual ones as possible (there's plenty of space in the bank
   for them) so that you can build up *exactly* the kit you want from them for
   each project.

   The easiest way to do this is to work across two parts eg. part 1 and part
   10 -  with part 10 set as kitmode with Drum mode checked.

   Load one of the wanted drums to part 1, then use C/P to copy the Add, Sub,
   Pad components across to one of the kit lines in part 10. Rinse and repeat.
   You then  set the min and max notes for each kit line. Kit items don't have
   to be in any order so kit 2 could be set to note 80 only, while kit 7 could
   be notes 80 to 83. etc.
