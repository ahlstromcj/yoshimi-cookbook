\section{Fun With Presets}
\label{sec:presets}

   This section expands on its counterpart in the  \textsl{Yoshimi User Manual},
   showing how presets can be employed to re-use blocks of settings.
   In this short tutorial, we will grab and save a number of presets,
   and then use them to partly reconstitute the sound.

\subsection{Presets / Paths}
\label{subsec:presets_paths}

   First, one needs to make sure to have one's
   \texttt{\textasciitilde/.config/yoshimi/presets} directory
   in the set of preset directories.
   Navigate to the \textbf{Main window / Paths / Preset Dirs...} menu entry
   and see if it is there.
   Add it if necessary.

   Second, make sure that there are some root directories available.
   Navigate to the \textbf{Main window / Paths / Bank Root Dirs...} menu entry
   and make sure at least the first of these directories are present:

   \begin{verbatim}
      /usr/share/yoshimi/banks (or in /usr/local if built from source)
      /usr/share/zynaddsubfx/banks
   \end{verbatim}

\subsection{Presets / Pick a Patch}
\label{subsec:presets_pick_a_patch}

   Now navigate to
   \textbf{Main window / Patch Sets / Show Patch Banks...}.
   Pick item \textbf{60. Pads}.
   In the Pads bank window that opens, pick \textbf{8. Resonance Pad1}.
   The following figure shows the set of windows that are now open:

\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering 
   \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{navigating-to-a-preset.png}
   \caption{Navigating to a Preset}
   \label{fig:presets_navigating_to_a_preset}
\end{figure}

   Take a moment to note each of the windows that are open now.
   Play the virtual keyboard for awhile, until the sound of this
   patch/instrument is memorized (we want to reconstruct this sound later).

   Now let's save some of the instrument's presets.
   Click the \textsl{Yoshimi} main window's \textbf{Edit} button.
   Oddly, this PAD instrument uses only the ADDsynth engine.
   Press the ADDsynth item's \textbf{Edit} button.
   Up comes the complex, multi-panelled window for the ADDsynth setup.
   Note the blue \textbf{C} and \textbf{P} buttons in each of the following
   sub-panels:

   \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Amplitude Env}
      \item \textbf{Amplitude LFO}
      \item \textbf{Filter Params}
      \item \textbf{Filter Env}
      \item \textbf{Filter LFO}
      \item \textbf{Frequency Env}
      \item \textbf{Frequency LFO}
      \item The whole \textbf{ADDsynth Window}
   \end{itemize}

   Let's save them all!  Click on each \textbf{C} button,
   then fill in the \textbf{Copy to Preset} text field with
   the name \textsl{"demo"}, and then press the \textbf{Copy to Preset}
   button.  All of the file-names that result will start with
   \texttt{demo}.

   Then click on "Show Voice Parameters", then click on the C
   button to save the one enabled sub-panel, "Frequency LFO".
   Note that the "demo" is already saved in this preset of
   type "Plfofrequency".  So, if we want to save this, we'd use a name other
   than "demo".  Click "Cancel".

   Click on C for the whole Addsynth voice window.  Go ahead and
   "Copy to Preset" named "demo".

   Now look in "~/.config/yoshimi/presets", and see all the saved files:

\begin{verbatim}
	$ ls ~/.config/yoshimi/presets
	demo.ADnoteParametersn.xpz (whole ADDsynth preset?)
	demo.ADnoteParameters.xpz (whole ADDsynth Voice preset?)
	demo.Penvamplitude.xpz
	demo.Penvfilter.xpz
	demo.Penvfrequency.xpz
	demo.Pfilter.xpz
	demo.Plfoamplitude.xpz
	demo.Plfofilter.xpz
	demo.Plfofrequency.xpz
\end{verbatim}

	Two of them are confounded with the same type, but different file-names.
	How?

   Now all are available for loading.  Take the "Simple Sound". 
   (Currently cannot be done via Instruments / Clear! Bug !!??)
   and listen to it via the virtual keyboard.
   Then click the "Edit" button, then the ADDsynth "Edit" button.
   Now load all of the presets above by clicking on each P button and
   then selecting the "demo" entry, and click the "Paste from Preset" button.
   After all this is done, you'll have pretty much recovered the 
   "Resonance Pad1" sound.

   In summary, the presets are essentially keyed to the sub-panels.
   In naming them, you need to use a name that represents the sound that the
   preset contributes, via the settings in its sub-panels.
