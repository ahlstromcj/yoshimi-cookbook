Simple outlines for some tutorial work before putting it into the cookbook
==========================================================================

Initial Installation:

   Install Yoshimi from a package manager or from source code.
   Install ZynAddSubFx from a package manager or from source code.
   Clone the yoshimi-cookbook project from GitHub.
   Clone the sequencer64 project from GitHub.

Start from scratch:

   Remove any existing Yoshimi configuration.

   $ cd ~/.config
   $ mv yoshimi/ yoshimi-orig

Restart Yoshimi:

   $ yoshimi --version
   Yoshimi is starting
   ConfigFile /home/ahlstrom/.config/yoshimi/yoshimi.config not found,
         will use default settings
   Missing bank file
   Scanning for banks
   Missing history file
   Yoshimi 1.3.9

   (This results in the creation of ~/.config/yoshimi and
   an empty ~/.config/yoshimi/presets directory.)

Load Example XMZ File (ALSA):

   Note that Yoshimi cannot find the parameters file if "/home/ahlstrom" is
   replaced with "~".

   $ yoshimi -a -A --load=/home/ahlstrom/Home/ca/mls/git/yoshimi-cookbook/
			yoshimi/examples/Out_There.xmz
	Yoshimi is starting
	ConfigFile /home/ahlstrom/.config/yoshimi/yoshimi.config not found,
         will use default settings
	Missing bank file
	Scanning for banks
	Missing history file
	March little endian = 1
	Format = Signed Little Endian 32 Bit 2 Channel
	Using alsa_audio for audio and alsa_midi for midi
	pLoaded Out_There parameters
	Yoshimi 1.3.9 rc3
	Clientname: yoshimi
	Config: Audio: alsa -> 'default'
	Midi: alsa -> 'default'
	Oscilsize: 512
	Samplerate: 48000
	Period size: 256

	Yay! We're up and running :-)
	yoshimi> exit
   System config has been changed.  Still exit N/y? y

	(This results in additional files in ~/.config/yoshimi:
      yoshimi.history
      yoshimi.banks
      yoshimi.windows
   )

   The history file contains a reference to the full path of the Out_There.xmz
   file.

   The banks file is a gzip-compressed XML file the references the default
   bank-root (bank-root 0): /usr/local/share/yoshimi/banks.  It also defines
   prefix number for all of the banks (bank directories) that ship with
   Yoshimi.  It also references the ZynAddSubFX bank location:
   /usr/share/zynaddsubfx/bank (bank-root 1).  It defines bank number for all
   the banks that ship with ZynAddSubFX.

   The windows file contains the locations of about 20 windows such as
   "master", "panel", "instruments", "SUBnote", "ADDnote", etc.

Playing the Out_There tune:

   Run Yoshimi as above.
   Run sequencer64 (or seq24 with busses set manually to 5, or whatever matches
   your system), and make sure to NOT use --manual-alsa-ports:

   $ sequencer64 --bus 5 Out_There.mid

   Delete the SMF 0 track that Sequencer64 creates as it converts this file to
   Sequencer64's SMF 1 format.

   Arm (unmute) all of the tracks in the main window view of Sequencer64.

   Play!  This setup can loop endlessly, and the differing lengths of the parts
   make it vary as it plays.

   When done, on't save either the Yoshimi parameters or the converted tune.

Setting up presets and playing with them:

Install cookbook files:

Setup:

   Keep cookbook stuff separate from regular stuff.  Put in

      ~/.config/yoshimi-cookbook
