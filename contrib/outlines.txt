Simple outlines for some tutorial work before putting it into the cookbook
==========================================================================

Initial Installation:

   Install Yoshimi from a package manager or from source code.
   Install ZynAddSubFx from a package manager or from source code.
   Clone the yoshimi-cookbook project from GitHub.
   Clone the sequencer64 project from GitHub.

Start from scratch:

   Remove any existing Yoshimi configuration.

   $ cd ~/.config
   $ mv yoshimi/ yoshimi-orig

Restart Yoshimi:

   $ yoshimi --version
   Yoshimi is starting
   ConfigFile /home/ahlstrom/.config/yoshimi/yoshimi.config not found,
         will use default settings
   Missing bank file
   Scanning for banks
   Missing history file
   Yoshimi 1.3.9

   (This results in the creation of ~/.config/yoshimi and
   an empty ~/.config/yoshimi/presets directory.)

Load Example XMZ File (ALSA):

   Note that Yoshimi cannot find the parameters file if "/home/ahlstrom" is
   replaced with "~".

   $ yoshimi -a -A --load=/home/ahlstrom/Home/ca/mls/git/yoshimi-cookbook/
			yoshimi/examples/Out_There.xmz
	Yoshimi is starting
	ConfigFile /home/ahlstrom/.config/yoshimi/yoshimi.config not found,
         will use default settings
	Missing bank file
	Scanning for banks
	Missing history file

	Config: Audio: alsa -> 'default'
	Midi: alsa -> 'default'
	Oscilsize: 512
	Samplerate: 48000
	Period size: 256

	Yay! We're up and running :-)
	yoshimi> exit
   System config has been changed.  Still exit N/y? y

	(This results in additional files in ~/.config/yoshimi:
      yoshimi.history
      yoshimi.banks
      yoshimi.windows
   )

   The history file contains a reference to the full path of the Out_There.xmz
   file.

   The banks file is a gzip-compressed XML file the references the default
   bank-root (bank-root 0): /usr/local/share/yoshimi/banks.  It also defines
   prefix number for all of the banks (bank directories) that ship with
   Yoshimi.  It also references the ZynAddSubFX bank location:
   /usr/share/zynaddsubfx/bank (bank-root 1).  It defines bank number for all
   the banks that ship with ZynAddSubFX.

   The windows file contains the locations of about 20 windows such as
   "master", "panel", "instruments", "SUBnote", "ADDnote", etc.

Playing the Out_There tune:

   Run Yoshimi as above.
   Run sequencer64 (or seq24 with busses set manually to 5, or whatever matches
   your system), and make sure to NOT use --manual-alsa-ports:

   $ sequencer64 --bus 5 Out_There.mid

   Delete the SMF 0 track that Sequencer64 creates as it converts this file to
   Sequencer64's SMF 1 format.

   Arm (unmute) all of the tracks in the main window view of Sequencer64.

   Play!  This setup can loop endlessly, and the differing lengths of the parts
   make it vary as it plays.

   When done, on't save either the Yoshimi parameters or the converted tune.

Setting up presets and playing with them:

   First, make sure to have your $HOME/.config/yoshimi/presets directory
   in your presets: Main window / Paths / Preset Dirs...
   Add it if necessary.

   Second, make sure that there are some root directories available.
   Main window / Paths / Bank Root Dirs...

      /usr/share/yoshimi/banks (or in /usr/local if built from source)
      /usr/share/zynaddsubfx/banks

   Then go to Main window / Patch Sets / Show Patch Banks...
   Pick item "60. Pads".  Then pick "8. Resonance Pad1".

   Now let's save some of it's presets.  Click the main window Edit button.
   Oddly, this pad uses only the ADDsynth engine.
   Press the ADDsynth "Edit" button.
   Note the C and P buttons for:

      Amplitude Env
      Amplitude LFO
      Filter Params
      Filter Env
      Filter LFO
      Frequency Env
      Frequency LFO
      The whole ADDsynth Window

   Let's save them all!  Click on each C button, then fill in the "Copy to
   Preset" text field with the name "demo", and press the "Copy to Preset"
   button.

   Then click on "Show Voice Parameters", then click on the C
   button to save the one enabled sub-panel, "Frequency LFO".
   Note that the "demo" is already saved in this preset of
   type "Plfofrequency".  So, if we want to save this, we'd use a name other
   than "demo".  Click "Cancel".

   Click on C for the whole Addsynth voice window.  Go ahead and
   "Copy to Preset" named "demo".

   Now look in "~/.config/yoshimi/presets", and see all the save files:

	$ ls ~/.config/yoshimi/presets

	demo.ADnoteParametersn.xpz (whole ADDsynth preset?)
	demo.ADnoteParameters.xpz (whole ADDsynth Voice preset?)
	demo.Penvamplitude.xpz
	demo.Penvfilter.xpz
	demo.Penvfrequency.xpz
	demo.Pfilter.xpz
	demo.Plfoamplitude.xpz
	demo.Plfofilter.xpz
	demo.Plfofrequency.xpz

	Two of them are confounded with the same type, but different file-names.
	How?

   Now all are available for loading.  Take the "Simple Sound". 
   (Currently cannot be done via Instruments / Clear! Bug !!??)
   and listen to it via the virtual keyboard.
   Then click the "Edit" button, then the ADDsynth "Edit" button.
   Now load all of the presets above by clicking on each P button and
   then selecting the "demo" entry, and click the "Paste from Preset" button.
   After all this is done, you'll have pretty much recovered the 
   "Resonance Pad1" sound.

   In summary, the presets are essentially keyed to the sub-panels.
   In naming them, you need to use a name that represents the sound that the
   preset contributes, via the settings in its sub-panels.

Install cookbook files:

Setup:

   Keep cookbook stuff separate from regular stuff.  Put in

      ~/.config/yoshimi-cookbook
