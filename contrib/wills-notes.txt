Hi Chris,

Now I'm easing back a bit on yoshimi in preparation for 1.4.0 release (at
last!) I had time to take a quick look at what's going on around :)

I'm pleased to see you've pulled in ride with yoshimi but an a bit puzzled by
the output messages. There seem to all of the early ones missing, so I don't
know how it could have played correctly!

Here is the list I get when running from the command line with:

aplaymidi -p yoshimi /data/source/RideWithYoshimi.mid

If you are already on root 9 bank 105 when you start, those messages wouldn't
appear. The *only* requirement is that root 9 contains the correct banks, not
that Yoshimi is already on it. That is a point I've had difficulty making clear
to lots of people, and is what makes Yoshimi's bank management superior to just
about anything else I've seen - but I would say that, wouldn't I :)

Oh, and the reason the file is smf0 is because it was created with arecordmidi.
This *should* play nice on any system, where smf1 might confuse old (ancient?)
programs.
