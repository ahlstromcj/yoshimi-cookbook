Ride With Yoshimi

Will sent me a nice demonstration MIDI file for Yoshimi.  Here we set it up for
playback in an arbitrary sequencer application.

   At the end of my LAC workshop I demonstrated a song being played using 16
   parts with multiple bank changes and program loads while playing, starting
   with a 'bare' Yoshimi. Although I used Rosegarden for this, I also have a
   MIDI file that runs here with:

      aplaymidi -p yoshimi /data/Source/RideWithYoshimi.mid

   If you are interested I can send that file to you. Its only requirements are
   that root ID 9 points to the default bank set supplied with Yoshimi, and
   default MIDI settings are in place.

So we start up Yoshimi (in ALSA mode!).  We open the banks dialog (menu Patch
Sets / Show Patch Banks).  In the banks dialog, we click the Roots button to
open the Bank Root Paths dialog.  In this dialog, We make sure
/usr/local/share/yoshimi/banks is the current root.  Then we change its ID
value to 9, and click the red Pending button.

Next, we start Sequencer64 (to use --buss 5, which is where Yoshimi sits on
our setup), and open the RideWithYoshimi.mid file.  Surprise, we see that
it is SMF 0 format, which Sequencer64 converts to SMF 1. We get rid of the
highlighted track, which contains the unconverted SMF 0 data.  We bring up the
Song Editor, hit "p" to enter paint mode, and click each of the 16 tracks into
place.  Finally, we save it as "RideWithYoshimi.midi", in Sequencer64 format.

Oh, then we play it, and it sounds very nice!

Here is the console output from Yoshimi while that song plays:

master % yoshimi -a -A
