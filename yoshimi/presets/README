Yoshimi Cookbook

For some reason, Yoshimi saves presets into a file of the form
.subsystem.xpz (such as .ADnoteParameters.xpz), without giving one
a chance to specify the file-name.

Better to rename or copy the file right away.  However,
that doesn't seem to make the file visible in the preset directory
management dialogs of Yoshimi.  This is an issue to work out.

Here are the files present in this directory so far:

   .ADnoteParameters.xpz

      Holds the latest presets saved from the ADDsynth Edit dialog.
      Copy this file to a better-named file for safe-keeping after
      using it.

   Nat Drum ADDsynth Tom Part.xpz

      This file is an attempt to extract the Tom drum kit item from the
      Natural Drum Kit patch provided in the yoshimi/banks/demos directory.
