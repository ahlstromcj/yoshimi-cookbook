   This is Oliver's (more than) hundred, a bank of patch files for
ZynAddSubFX.  I strongly encourage you to adapt these sounds to your
own use and to share your creations.

Important: many of these sounds have directions which you may view by
selecting "Edit instrument" from the advanced user interface window.
Many of the lead instruments have a vibrato effect controlled by the
modulation wheel.  Setting the modulation to zero gives a steady tone,
but a newly initialized voice assumes the modulation wheel is at 64.

Note: the combis were removed and the organ parts are patches 123 for
the main tone and 124 for the percussion.  The chirpy upper part is
patch 121, and layering it over soft saw lead (114) sounds much better
to my ears.  Give it a whirl.

Wishing you well with your musical endeavors,
Christopher Oliver
